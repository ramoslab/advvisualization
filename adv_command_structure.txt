Specification of how to control the program for the advanced feedback and how to send data through the TCP connection.

# ### Command table ### #

ADDEXO - Add new exo
Command structure:
ADDEXO EXOTYPE HANDEDNESS PARAMETERS

Parameters:
Exotype - String that specifies the type of the exo to be added
Handedness - String (either "left" or "right") that specifies the type of arm that should be added
Parameters - Parameters needed by that exo type

DELETE - Delete exo
Command structure:
DELETE EXOID

Parameters
Exoid - Id of the exo to be removed

DATA - Send data 
Command structure:
DATA EXOID PARAMETERS

Parameters:
Exoid - The unique Id of the exo
Parameters - Parameters of the degrees of freedom, like for the EXOSTATIC type: BaseXpos,BaseYpos,BaseHeading,PronoRoll,IndexHeading,GroupHeading,ThumbHeading

TOGGLEMAT - Add or change the mat. If a mat already exists in the scene this mat is replaced.
Command structure:
TOGGLEMAT HANDEDNESS

Parameters:
Handedness - String (either "left" or "right") that specifies the type of the mat to be added.

ADDBASE - Add an exo that only consists of the base and the armrest without the fingers.
Command structure
ADDBASE EXOTYPE PARAMETERS

Parameters:
Exotype - String that specifies the type of the exo to be added
Parameters - Parameters needed by that exo type

SETCOLOR - Set the color of an exo
Command structure:
SETCOLOR EXOID COLOR

Parameters:
Exoid - The unique id of the exo
Color - An RGB color in the format red,green,blue (values from 0 to 1)

TOGGLETRANSPARENCY - Toggle transparency of an exo
Command structure:
TOGGLETRANSPARENCY EXOID

Parameters:
Exoid - The unique id of the exo

TOGGLEMAT - Add or change the orientation of the mat (for experiment with left or right hand)
Command structure:
TOGGLEMAT SIDE

Parameters:
Side - Specifies which hand is being trained ('LEFT' or 'RIGHT')

SETBGCOLOR - Set the color of the background
Command structure:
SETBGCOLOR COLOR

Parameters:
Color - An RGB color in the format red,green,blue (values from 0 to 1)

ROTATECAMERA - Rotate the camera by some degrees around the center of the mat
Command structure:
ROTATECAMERA ANGLE

Parameters:
Angle - An angle in degrees

EXIT - End visualisation (close Panda3D)
Command structure:
EXIT


# ### Exotypes ### #

EXOSTATIC - Add new exo that stays at a static position
Parameters:
List of positions and parameters, separated by commas.
X-Position of the base,
y-Position of the base,
heading of the base,
roll of the pronation module,
heading of the index finger,
heading of the finger group,
heading of the thumb

Explanation:
This exo stays at the specified position until it is removed from the scene or the program ends. It can be used for specifying the target position the patients have to reach.

EXOKEYBOARD - Add new exo that is controlled by the keyboard
Parameters:
- none -

Explanation:
Focus the window that shows the 3D visualisation (e.g. move the mouse to the window that shows the feedback and click). All keyboard controlled exos are controlled by the keyboard. Arrow keys control heading and movement direction of the base. Pronation and supination are controlled by "r" and "f", index, finger group and the thumb are controlled by "q" and "a", "w" and "s" and "e" and "r", respectively.

EXOREALTIME - Add new exo that listens to data coming from a tcp connection
Parameters:
- none -

Explanation:
This exo is controlled via tcp using the DATA command.
